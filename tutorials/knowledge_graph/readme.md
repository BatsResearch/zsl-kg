## How to setup a knowledge graph?

In this tutorial, we will learn how to setup up a knowledge graph object,
which can be used with the graph neural networks in the `zsl-kg` framework.
### GloVe Download
The knowledge graph object stores features or pretrained embeddings. In this tutorial, we will be using the pretrained GloVe embeddings for the node features. To download GloVe, follow these instructions:

```
wget https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip
unzip glove.840B.300d.zip
```

Install `zsl-kg` (crowd cheering) and follow the rest of the instructions in the jupyter notebook.
